Implements Persistit&trade;'s core functionality.
</p>
<p>
Applications initialize and close Persistit through an instance of the
{@link com.persistit.Persistit} class. A Persistit instance must be
initialized through one of the 
{@link com.persistit.Persistit#initialize initialize} methods, and
must be closed by the  
{@link com.persistit.Persistit#close close} to ensure all updates
are written to disk.
</p>
<p>
Applications interact with Persistit through instances of {@link com.persistit.Exchange}.
An <code>Exchange</code> has two important associated member objects, a {@link com.persistit.Key}
and a {@link com.persistit.Value}. A <code>Key</code> is a mutable representation of a
key, and a <code>Value</code> is a mutable representation of a value.  Applications
manipulate these objects and interact with the database through one of the following
four general patterns:
</p>
<ol>
<li> 
Modify the <code>Key</code>, perform a {@link com.persistit.Exchange#fetch fetch} 
operation, and query the <code>Value</code>.
</li>
<li>
Modify the <code>Key</code>, modify the <code>Value</code>, and then perform a
{@link com.persistit.Exchange#store store} operation to insert or replace data
in the database.
</li>
<li>
Modify the <code>Key</code>, and then perform a 
{@link com.persistit.Exchange#remove remove} to remove one or more key/value pairs.
</li>
<li>
Optionally modify the <code>Key</code>, perform a 
{@link com.persistit.Exchange#traverse traverse},
{@link com.persistit.Exchange#traverse next} or
{@link com.persistit.Exchange#traverse previous}, then query the 
resulting state of <code>Key</code> and/or <code>Value</code> to enumerate key/value pairs
currently stored in the database.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Additional methods of <code>Exchange</code> include 
{@link com.persistit.Exchange#fetchAndStore fetchAndStore}
and {@link com.persistit.Exchange#fetchAndRemove fetchAndRemove}.  
These atomically modify the database
and return the former value associated with the <code>Key</code>.
</p>
<p>
Every <code>Exchange</code> has an associated {@link com.persistit.Transaction
Transaction} object that represents its current transactional state.  Every 
operation performed by any of the access or update methods of the 
<code>Exchange</code> is performed within the context of this <code>Transaction</code>, 
meaning that its result is atomic, consistent, isolated and durable (the ACID properties).  
By default these methods behave as if the bounded by {@link com.persistit.Transaction#begin begin}
{@link com.persistit.Transaction#commit commit} and
{@link com.persistit.Transaction#end end} calls on the <code>Transaction</code>.
An application can group multiple operations together by explicitly invoking
<code>begin</code>, <code>commit</code> and <code>end</code> calls.  See 
{@link com.persistit.Transaction} for further information.
</p>
<p>
The Persistit database is stored in physical files managed by {@link com.persistit.Volume Volume}s.
A <code>Volume</code> contains an unbounded number of logical {@link com.persistit.Tree Tree}s, each
of which constitutes a physical balanced tree.
</p>
<p>
{@link com.persistit.IntegrityCheck IntegrityCheck} provides a simple mechanism to verify
the internal integrity of <code>Volume</code>s and/or individual <code>Tree</code>s.
</p>
<p>
This package also includes {@link com.persistit.PersistitMap PersistitMap} which
provides a persistent, fast implementation of <code>java.util.SortedMap</code>.
</p>
<p>
Finally, an application can obtain an instance of a 
{@link com.persistit.Management} object that exposes an API 
for measuring performance data, sizes and utilization
of database volumes, and many other elements from the
{@link com.persistit.Persistit#getManagement} method.  Optionally this class
can be exported via Java RMI (Remote Method Invocation) to permit administration
from a connected workstation.
