Implements extended encoding of objects and strings to and from 
{@link com.persistit.Key}s and {@link com.persistit.Value}s.
</p>
<p>
There are three kinds of encoding mechanisms used in Persistit&trade;:
<ol>
<li>
Encoding and decoding of objects to and from <tt>Key</tt>s,
</li>
<li>
Specialized encoding and decoding of <tt>java.lang.String</tt>s to 
and from <tt>Key</tt>s, and
</li>
<li>
Encoding and decoding of objects to and from <tt>Value</tt>s.
</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
These mechanisms are each slightly different because the correct 
collation of key values depends on the encoding of primitive values and
<tt>Objects</tt> into <tt>Key</tt>s, whereas collation is not an issue
for the encoding of <tt>Value</tt>s. The encoding of <tt>Key</tt>s also differs 
from the encoding of <tt>Value</tt>s because although collation is not
an issue for <tt>Value</tt>s, generally the kinds of objects
serialized into <tt>Value</tt>s will be much more complex than those
usefully encoded into <tt>Key</tt>s.
</p>
<p>
Logic for these two different uses is specified by twp different
interfaces, {@link com.persistit.encoding.KeyCoder} and
{@link com.persistit.encoding.ValueCoder}. 
Each of these has methods to translate an <tt>Object</tt> to and from an array
of bytes.
</p>
<p>
The specific <tt>KeyCoder</tt> or <tt>ValueCoder</tt> to use in
encoding or decoding a <tt>Key</tt> or <tt>Value</tt> is determined
by the current {@link com.persistit.encoding.CoderManager}.  Persistit
has a singleton <tt>CoderManager</tt> at all times.  The
{@link com.persistit.DefaultCoderManager} is a simple 
implementation that permits applications to register a <tt>KeyCoder</tt>
and <tt>ValueCoder</tt> implementation for each class that requires
extended encoding and decoding.
</p>
<p>
Note that a <tt>ValueCoder</tt> registered for a given class overrides
default serialization behavior for that class.  A <tt>ValueCoder</tt>
can encode state information from a class that is not marked
<tt>java.io.Serializable</tt> or <tt>java.io.Externalizable</tt>.  In addition, a
<tt>ValueCoder</tt> typically represents the state of an object much more
concisely than standard object serialization because all class names
are represented by system-wide handles rather than class names. (See the
{@link com.persistit.ClassIndex} class for details on how
classes are mapped to small integer handles.)
</p>
<a name="_renderers"></a>
<h3><tt>KeyRenderer</tt> and <tt>ValueRenderer</tt></h3>
<p>
The interfaces {@link com.persistit.encoding.KeyRenderer} and 
{@link com.persistit.encoding.ValueRenderer} extends <tt>KeyCoder</tt> and
<tt>ValueCoder</tt> by adding a <tt>render</tt> method.  The purpose is 
to allow the application to pass a mutable object that the renderer 
populates with decoded data, rather than creating a new object 
for each decoded value. This mutable object, called the <tt>target</tt>, 
may be of a different class than the originally encoded value. It is up 
to the <tt>KeyRenderer</tt> or <tt>ValueRenderer</tt> implementation
to determine whether a target object is a suitable recipient for the decoded data.
</p>
<p>
This mechanism can be used to retrieve a subset of all the information that was
originally encoded as part of a complex object into a simpler "rendition" object.
For example, to display the name, sex and date of birth of numerous complex
Person objects, the application could define a class called PersonNameSexDob having
only those fields.  It could then define a <tt>ValueRenderer</tt> registered to
the Person class that reads and populates only the three relevant fields and skips
the rest.  The resulting PersonNameSexDob object could then provide the data
for a summarized listing of Person objects.
</p>
<p>
The {@link com.persistit.DefaultObjectCoder} class 
provides a convenient implementation of these interfaces. It uses 
Java reflection to read and write the fields of an object to and 
from Persistit <tt>Value</tt>s and <tt>Key</tt>s.
</p>
<p>
Finally, the {@link com.persistit.encoding.ObjectCache} class provides a
simple cache for previously loaded objects.  Unlike the Persistit buffer
pool, <tt>ObjectCache</tt> caches a fully realized object, rather than pages
containing byte arrays from which objects can be deserialized.  
<tt>ObjectCache</tt> is similar to a <tt>java.util.WeakHashMap</tt>, but
implements different removal rules that are more appropriate for
caching persistent objects.
