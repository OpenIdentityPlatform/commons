/**
 * Persistit rev: 284
 * 
 * The volume header has a field to store the creation time. This isn't used for
 * anything directly but is displays through various interfaces (management,
 * JMX). Other than being a nice attribute for reference, having the value be
 * real would make for a nice sanity check when debugging various issues (could
 * compare to journal creation times, etc).
 * 
 * The creation time is saved in the statistics structure upon first creation
 * (VolumeStorageT2()#create() -> #truncate()), but the value isn't copied into
 * the header area after that (#flushMetaData() -> updateMetaData()).
