     * 
     * A transaction creates an table index and commits. Subsequently many
     * threads read the index. Because there are no other update transactions
     * the TransactionStatus for the index creation remains present in the
     * TransactionIndex, and therefore the concurrent reader threads are slowed
     * by contention on the bucket lock in getStatus.
     * 
     * Fixing this could improve performance in some scenarios. For example,
     * customer creates a new index and then starts a bunch of concurrent query
     * threads. Note that ongoing replication clears the condition relatively
     * quickly, so this is a condition that requires little or no update
     * activity subsequent to index creation. The bug is exploited particularly
     * on indexes because query threads traverse the index and repeatedly see
     * MVVs with the same transaction's start timestamp.
