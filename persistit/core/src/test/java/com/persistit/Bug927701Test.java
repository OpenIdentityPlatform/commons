/**
 * Failure detected during TPCC testing. Upon restarting server, the following
 * error was emitted:
 * 
 * [main] ERROR Recovery failed due to
 * com.persistit.exception.CorruptJournalException: Missing journal file
 * /home/akiban
 * /dev/persistit/fix-pruning-deadlock2/bench/run/../data/BenchmarkSQL_journal
 * .000000000011 - the journal needs to be repaired or discarded
 * 
 * This is a false positive. The data is not actually corrupt. RecoveryManager
 * thinks it needs journal file 11 because the transaction map at the front of
 * file 12 lists transactions that started in file 11. However, all of these
 * aborted and were subsequently pruned, and the lastValidCheckpoint in file 12
 * has a base address in file 12.
 * 
 * Upon further examination, the circumstances are a little different than my
 * initial view. Journal file 12 had several checkpoint records. Each checkpoint
 * contains the base address current at the time that checkpoint was written.
 * The base value actually _decreased_ between the first and second CP records
 * and then increased again. This indicates an unknown failure mechanism in the
 * JournalManager.
 * 
 * Note that this failure occurred while the wwLock bug 923761 was occurring.
 * One side-effect of that bug would be for a thread to have a start timestamp
 * and then be delayed by up to a minute before being aborted.
