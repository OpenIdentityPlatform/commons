/**
 * https://bugs.launchpad.net/akiban-persistit/+bug/1010079
 * 
 * Various symptoms found while running stress test mixture_txn_1, including
 * CorruptVolumeException, CorruptValueException, and several different asserts.
 * These all stem from new code introduced in
 * lp:~pbeaman/akiban-persistit/fix_1006576_long_record_pruning. This bug is
 * related to 1005206 and 1006576. Diagnosis:
 * 
 * New code added to prune LongRecord MVVs operates on a copy of the original
 * buffer and then atomically refreshes the original buffer from the copy. That
 * operation fails to invalidate the FastIndex of the original buffer in the
 * event a key is removed due to a LongRecord MVV becoming a primordial
 * anti-value.
 * 
 * In addition, pruneLongMvvValues uses a Value object obtained from a
 * ThreadLocal. However, this same Value is already in use by
 * Exchange#storeInternal.
