     * This method tries to recreate the state at which the journal files in bug
     * 1065677 arrived. Plan:
     * 
     * 1. Write a transaction that updates multiple pages.
     * 
     * 2. Flush all buffers so that there are pages to recover and then crash
     * Persistit so there is no checkpoint.
     * 
     * 3. Restart Persistit, but advance the system timestamp to simulate
     * somewhat chaotic ordering of page writes created by reapplying a huge
     * delete operation in the transaction.
     * 
     * 4. Crash once again. This will leave pages from the original epoch in the
     * page map and will add versions of those pages with larger timestamps.
     * This crash simulates the JVM being killed during recovery processing. In
     * the actual case it appears there is no post-recovery checkpoint, merely
     * lots of dirty pages. To simulate this outcome we truncate about 50K of
     * bytes form the end of the journal file as a surrogate for the system
     * having not completed recovery.
     * 
     * 5. Restart the system once again. Now do some normal processing work,
     * simulated here by adding another transaction.
     * 
     * 6. Magic happens here: we now perform a rollover, which writes both the
     * branch map and the page map into a single PM record. Because the PM
     * record is written by two separate loops, some page P found in both the
     * branch map and the page map is written into two separate PM sub-records.
     * As it turns out, the version in the branch map has a smaller timestamp
     * than the one in the page map. This sets up the AssertionError.
     * 
     * 7. Restart Persistit to exploit the bug during scanLoadPageMap.
     *
