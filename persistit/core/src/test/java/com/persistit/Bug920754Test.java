     * 
     * While working on my "ApiTestBase turbo" branch, I noticed the volume file
     * growing faster than I expected. I put a debug point in ApiTestBase's
     * 
     * @After method, when it should be compressing journals and such. When I
     * looked in the persistit UI, I saw that there were a few trees still
     * defined but with nothing in them; the AIS (which I looked into via the
     * DXL jmx bean) had only the primordial tables. But _directory contained
     * what looked like "a whole ton" of accumulators, for trees that no longer
     * existed.
     * 
     * To reproduce: - lp:~yshavit/akiban-server/ApiTestBase_turbo -r 1440 -
     * conditional breakpoint at ApiTestBase #274
     * ("System.out.println("flushing");"), to be triggered when size >= 400 *
     * 1024 * 1024. - look in persistit UI at the _directory tree. It should be
     * empty; it's very full.
     * 
     * From within the debugger, I invoked a checkpoint. Judging from write
     * time, the journal file did seem to have been written to; but the
     * accumulators didn't go away.
