     * Bug seen many times but only in a large (100 terminal), long running TPCC
     * test as a hung thread inside of Buffer#repack() due to _alloc appearing
     * to have a zero-ed out header. This turned out to be a secondary issue to
     * the real problem.
     * 
     * The Exchange#storeInternal() method tracks a number of variables related
     * to long record chains. There are four in total: new and old for value
     * being stored and MVV itself. Logically, we don't need to keep new ones if
     * the store doesn't succeed and we can't free old ones until we have
     * committed the new. We also don't need create multiple long record chains
     * for the new one if we have to retry for any reason (e.g. split) as it
     * isn't visible to anyone else yet. Conversely, we do have to create
     * multiple long MVVs (if required) upon retry as the state of the MVV may
     * have changed in-between.
     * 
     * That is where the real bug was. The storeInternal() method would
     * incorrectly track the old long MVV pointer across retries. Imagine this
     * sequence: 1) txn1 stores value at A 2) txn2 tries to store at A but is
     * stopped due to WW 3) txn2 releases latches and sleeps for short period 4)
     * txn1 aborts 5) txn2 wakes, sees tx1n aborted, and retries 6) A is
     * converted to short record (pruned, short stored, etc) 7) txn2 re-acquires
     * page and successfully stores value at A
     * 
     * If the value during step 2 was a long MVV and was reduced to a short MVV
     * at step 6 (which would free the long record chain), then when txn2
     * completed at step 7 it would still be holding onto the old long record
     * pointer.
     * 
     * Ultimately, that resulted in the same page address being on the garbage
     * list twice. When the first came off and was being used for data and then
     * simultaneously being used for as the garbage root, we would see the end
     * result of _alloc appearing to be junk/zeroed out.
