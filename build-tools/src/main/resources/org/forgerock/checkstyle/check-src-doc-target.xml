<module name="Checker">

  <!-- 
    This Checkstyle configuration defines additional checks which should be
    enabled for source code which is intended for inclusion in documentation or
    site content. Specifically:
    
    * source code must not contain lines which are greater than 80 characters
      in order to fit on an A4 page (70 is recommended)
      
    * long methods are not allowed since these will be hard to read and will
      very likely split across more than one page
      
    * methods containing too many parameters are not allowed since this
      indicates that the method will be hard to understand.
