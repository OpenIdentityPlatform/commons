  <section name="About Default Branding">

   <p>
    By default, ForgeRock core documentation uses the branding from this project.

    The branding project contains CSS for in-progress and released docs,
    and custom docbkx stylesheets for supported output formats.
   </p>

   <p>
    In order to use the default branding, get a common content artifact
    by using the <code>maven-dependency-plugin</code> goal, <code>unpack</code>.
