// To be included

    This is some arbitrary text
    that includes an ampersand &,
    that is surrounded by whitespace,
        and that has an indent on the last line. 

// To be included

 // Rough indentation
 This text is indented.
  But the indentation is not regular.
       So some of the lines
    Are indented further than others.
  And yet all the lines
               have at least a space of indentation.

(Perhaps leading tabs should cause an error.)
In general we don't know how many spaces a tab represents in your editor.
Convert leading tabs to spaces.
