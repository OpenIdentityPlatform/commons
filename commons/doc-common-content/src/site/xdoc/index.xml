  <section name="About Common Content">

   <p>
    Some of the content in Open Identity Platform core documentation is common to all books.

    This common content is provided as a separate Maven project
    that is maintained independently of any particular documentation set.

    The common Open Identity Platform content includes text and images
    in formats suitable for inclusion in DocBook 5 XML based core documentation.
   </p>

   <p>
    In order to use the common content, get a common content artifact
    by using the <code>maven-dependency-plugin</code> goal, <code>unpack</code>.
