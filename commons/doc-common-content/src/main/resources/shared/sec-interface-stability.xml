 <title>ForgeRock Product Interface Stability</title>

 <para>
  ForgeRock products support many protocols, APIs, GUIs,
  and command-line interfaces.

  Some of these interfaces are standard and very stable.

  Others offer new functionality that is continuing to evolve.
 </para>

 <para>
  We realize that you invest in these interfaces,
  and therefore must know when and how ForgeRock expects them to change.

  For that reason, ForgeRock defines interface stability labels
  and uses these definitions in ForgeRock products.
 </para>

 <variablelist>
  <varlistentry>
   <term>Stable</term>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     This documented interface is expected to undergo only
     backwards-compatible changes between major releases.

     Changes are announced at least one minor release before they take effect.
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </varlistentry>

  <varlistentry>
   <term>Evolving</term>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     This documented interface is continuing to evolve
     and so is expected to change,
     potentially in backwards-incompatible ways even in a minor release.

     Changes are documented at the time of product release.
    </para>

    <para>
     While new protocols and APIs are still in the process of standardization,
     they are Evolving.

     This applies for example to recent Internet-Draft implementations,
     and also to newly developed functionality.
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </varlistentry>

  <varlistentry>
   <term>Deprecated</term>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     This interface is deprecated
     and likely to be removed in a future release.

     For previously stable interfaces,
     the change was likely announced in a previous release.

     Deprecated interfaces will be removed from ForgeRock products.
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </varlistentry>

  <varlistentry>
   <term>Removed</term>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     This interface was deprecated in a previous release
     and has now been removed from the product.
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </varlistentry>

  <varlistentry>
   <term>Internal/Undocumented</term>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Internal and undocumented interfaces can change without notice.

     If you depend on one of these interfaces,
     contact ForgeRock support
     or email <link xlink:href="mailto:info@forgerock.com">info@forgerock.com</link>
     to discuss your needs.
