# ForgeRock Commons REST (CREST) examples

## What are the CREST examples?

For an overview of CREST and its related HTTP protocol please refer to the [README](../README.md) in the parent project.

## Getting started

You can quickly try out a [simple CREST HTTP application](src/main/java/org/forgerock/json/resource/http/examples)
using the following commands in a terminal:

```
$ git clone ssh://git@stash.forgerock.org:7999/commons/forgerock-rest.git
$ cd forgerock-rest
$ mvn clean:install
$ cd json-resource-examples
$ mvn jetty:run
```

The parent project's [README](../README.md) includes some sample interactions with the example application.
