/**
 * Elements common to requests and responses.
 *
 * <p>A message is a resource container, and thus needs to be {@linkplain java.io.Closeable#close() closed} in order
 * to free-up acquired resources.
 *
 * <p>Please carefully note the following regarding closing a message:
 * the asynchronous nature of both {@link org.forgerock.http.Handler} and {@link org.forgerock.http.Filter} that produce
 * {@linkplain org.forgerock.util.promise.Promise promises} of {@link Response} make it impossible to know,
 * for the producer of the message, when it can be closed. Thus, the responsibility of closing the message
 * is on the final consumer: the point after which the message is no longer used.
 *
 * <p>Example of such situations:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>In a {@link org.forgerock.http.Filter}: Production and forwarding of a new {@link Response} instance
 *     in one of the callbacks ({@link org.forgerock.util.Function} / {@link org.forgerock.util.AsyncFunction})
 *     attached to a promise, instead of the given {@code response} parameter.</li>
 *     <li>When consuming/extracting something out of a {@code response} because a different type
 *     (not {@link Response}) has to be returned.</li>
 * </ul>
