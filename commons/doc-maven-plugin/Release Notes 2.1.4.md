# ForgeRock Documentation Tools 2.1.4 Release Notes

ForgeRock Documentation Tools is a catch all for the doc build artifacts,
sites where we post release documentation,
and the documentation about documentation.

The link to the online issue tracker is
<https://bugster.forgerock.org/jira/browse/DOCS>.

## Compatibility

This release introduces a new configuration setting with the fix for DOCS-194.

It does not introduce any incompatible changes.


## Improvements & New Features

**DOCS-194: Add option to allow merge of generated and docbkx source directories**

You can now use the Maven configuration setting
`<overwriteGeneratedSource>true</overwriteGeneratedSource>`
together the `boilerplate` goal to overwrite files
from `docbkxSourceDirectory` to `docbkxGeneratedSourceDirectory`.

The default value, `false`, maintains compatibility with earlier versions.


## Bugs Fixed

**DOCS-197: Prepending â†ª on mouseover is distracting**

**DOCS-59: Only the draft documents are optimized to appear in Google searches; the final docs need to be SEO too.**

The fix adds a robots meta tag (noindex, nofollow) to site HTML,
that it then removes from release HTML.


## Known Issues

**DOCS-132: Soft hyphens used to break lines are rendered in PDF as hyphen + space**

Although soft hyphens are not used in this release,
the line break for hyphenation still remains.

See <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOP-2358>.

Workaround: Fix the content after copy/paste.

**DOCS-150: When a code sample is unwrapped, it it not limited to the width of the page**

**DOCS-163: The performance="optional" attr in a step has no effect**
